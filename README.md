# Error-Correcting-Image-Codec
A Python-based toolkit for image compression and transmission error resilience. This project leverages Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for image data compression and Reed-Solomon coding for error correction, showcasing the recovery of images from transmission-induced errors.
